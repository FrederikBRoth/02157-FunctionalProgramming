Problem 2

f "a" [1;2;3]
=> (a,1) :: f "a" [2;3]
=> (a,1) :: (a,2) :: f "a" [3]
=> (a,1) :: (a,2) :: (a,3) :: f "a" []
=> (a,1) :: (a,2) :: (a,3) :: []
=> [(a,1);(a,2);(a,3)]

Problem 3

The type is string int due to how the tuple is created. the first argument "a" put together with the elements of the int list.
